# Custom Instructions for AI Agent

This task focuses on simplifying a complex demo repository for Google's **Gemini 2.0 Flash Multimodal Live API**. The API enables real-time audio and video streaming with tool use, but the current React- and TypeScript-based demo is too complex for beginners. The goal is to reimplement its core features using **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, minimizing dependencies to create an intuitive and lightweight starting point.

### Key Objectives

1. **Simplify Complexity**: 
   Strip away React and TypeScript abstractions, focusing only on the essential API functionality.
   
2. **Core Functionality**:
   - Establish a WebSocket connection to the Gemini 2.0 API.
   - Stream audio and video in real time.
   - Display video output and visualize audio volume.
   - Provide simple UI controls (e.g., start/stop streaming).

3. **Maintain Modularity**: 
   Keep code organized and easy to debug, with standalone modules for API communication, media streaming, and UI handling.

### Implementation Steps

1. Replace the React demo with a minimal implementation using **vanilla technologies**.
2. Focus on lightweight, intuitive UI design.
3. Avoid unnecessary dependencies, prioritizing native APIs and modularity.
4. Provide clear inline documentation and a concise README.

### Deliverables

1. **Minimal App**: A single-page application demonstrating real-time API interactions.
2. **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Instructions for resolving common errors (e.g., WebSocket issues).
3. **Documentation**: Developer-friendly setup and usage instructions.

This streamlined reimplementation will make the API accessible to a broader range of developers, offering a clear and functional entry point without the overhead of a production-ready framework.
