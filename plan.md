# Milestone-Based Implementation Plan with Troubleshooting Steps

## Milestone 1: Project Setup
- **Goal**: Set up the project directory and files.
- **Implementation**: Create the project structure with `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Ensure the directory structure matches the plan.
  - Check that all files are correctly linked.

## Milestone 2: Establish WebSocket Connection
- **Goal**: Open a WebSocket connection to the Gemini 2.0 Flash API.
- **Implementation**: Write a function in `script.js` to connect to the WebSocket using the API endpoint.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Verify the WebSocket URL is correct.
  - Check for network issues that may prevent connection.

## Milestone 3: Stream Handling
- **Goal**: Handle incoming and outgoing streams.
- **Implementation**: Implement functions to process incoming audio/video data and send outgoing messages.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Test for correct data encoding/decoding.
  - Ensure proper handling of stream events like `onopen`, `onmessage`, and `onerror`.

## Milestone 4: UI Development
- **Goal**: Develop a user interface for interaction.
- **Implementation**: Create buttons and visual indicators for streaming control in `index.html` and `styles.css`.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Check for UI responsiveness.
  - Ensure that UI elements trigger the correct JavaScript functions.

## Milestone 5: Audio/Video Integration
- **Goal**: Integrate real-time audio and video streaming.
- **Implementation**: Use the `<video>` element and JavaScript to handle real-time media.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Test audio/video synchronization.
  - Handle different media formats and browser compatibility.

## Milestone 6: Volume Visualization
- **Goal**: Implement audio volume visualization.
- **Implementation**: Create a visual representation of audio volume in real-time.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Ensure accurate representation of volume levels.
  - Check for smooth visual updates in sync with audio.

## Milestone 7: Testing and Debugging
- **Goal**: Ensure the application works as expected.
- **Implementation**: Conduct thorough testing of all features.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Use browser developer tools to debug issues.
  - Check console logs for errors and fix them.

## Milestone 8: Optimization and Cleanup
- **Goal**: Optimize performance and clean up code.
- **Implementation**: Refactor code for efficiency and readability.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Profile the application to find performance bottlenecks.
  - Review code for potential memory leaks.

## Milestone 9: Documentation
- **Goal**: Document the code and usage instructions.
- **Implementation**: Write comments and create a `README.md` file.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Ensure documentation is clear and comprehensive.
  - Validate all instructions and examples.

## Milestone 10: Deployment
- **Goal**: Deploy the web client for public access.
- **Implementation**: Choose a hosting service and deploy the application.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Check for deployment issues like failed builds or server errors.
  - Monitor the application post-deployment for any runtime issues.

This plan provides a structured approach to building the web client, with each milestone focusing on a specific aspect of the development process. Troubleshooting steps are included to address common issues that may arise during implementation.
